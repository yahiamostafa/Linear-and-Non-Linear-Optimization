# Linear-and-Non-Linear-Optimization

First if you want to run this project, You have to install the requierd libraries

run this command 
``` pip3 install -r requierments.txt ```

### Unconstrained Non Linear Optimization
Which is a type of problems where the objective function is non-linear and it doesn't have any constrains 

Taking $f(x1,x2) = (x1 - 2 ) ^ 2 + (x2 - 2) ^ 2$ which is a function in two variables **x1 , x2**.

Now we need to solve this problem and find the optimal point, you can get it from the graph which is **(2 , 2)**. but what if we can't graph the functions if it has more than 2 variables.
